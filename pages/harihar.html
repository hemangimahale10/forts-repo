    <p> <b> Harihar fort / Harshagad is a fort located 40 km from Nashik City, 48 km from Igatpuri, 40 km from Ghoti in Nashik district, of Maharashtra, India. It is an important fort in Nashik district, and was constructed to look upon the trade route through Gonda Ghat. It receives many visitors because of its peculiar rock-cut steps. Harihar fort was built during the Seuna (Yadava) dynasty period. It was surrendered to Khan Zamam in 1636 along with Trymbak and other Pune forts. The fort was captured by Captain Briggs in 1818 along with 17 other forts. </b> </p>
