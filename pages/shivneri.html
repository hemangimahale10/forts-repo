    <p> <b> Shivneri Fort is an ancient military fortification located near Junnar in Pune district in Maharashtra, India. It is the birthplace of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the founder of Maratha Empire. Shivneri got its name as it was under the possession of the Yadavas of Devagiri. In 1595, a Maratha chief named Maloji Bhosale, the grandfather of Shivaji Maharaj Bhosale, was enobled by the Ahmadnagar Sultan, Bahadur Nizam Shah and he gave him Shivneri and Chakan. Shivaji Maharaj was born at the fort on 19 February 1630 (some accounts place it 1627), and spent his childhood there. Inside the fort is a small temple dedicated to goddess Shivai Devi, after whom Shivaji was named. </b> </p>
