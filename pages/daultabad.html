    <p> <b> The construction of Daulatabad Fort is credited to Bhillama V, the first Yadava king, who commissioned it around 1187 AD. He also established a township around the site and made it his capital. At that time, it was known as Deogiri, which means the Hill of the Gods. In Hindu lore, Lord Shiva is believed to have stayed on the hills surrounding this region. Hence the fort was originally known as Devagiri, literally "hills of god". </b> </p>
